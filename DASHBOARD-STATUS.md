# Dashboard Analytics Status

## Current Status (July 26, 2025)

### ✅ Working Components
1. **Supabase Integration**
   - Environment variables properly configured
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies fixed to allow event inserts
   - Events are being successfully stored in database
   - Test confirmed 11 events in database including 2 form submissions

2. **Analytics Tracking**
   - `/api/analytics/track` endpoint functioning
   - Events being captured with proper data structure
   - Form submissions, page views, and other events recording correctly

3. **Dashboard Infrastructure**
   - Dashboard loads without JavaScript errors
   - Authentication working (password: atlas2024)
   - API endpoints returning data correctly
   - Charts and UI components rendering properly

### ⚠️ Known Issues
1. **Dashboard displays 0 leads** despite having form submission data
   - API returns correct data: 2 form_submit events exist
   - Issue appears to be in dashboard.js data transformation logic
   - Possible cause: mismatch between `event` and `event_name` properties

### 🛠️ Debugging Tools
- `/debug-dashboard.html` - Interactive tool to trace data flow
- `/test-dashboard-api.html` - Tests API endpoints directly
- `/simulate-tracking.html` - Generates test tracking events

### 📝 Next Steps
1. Use debug-dashboard.html to identify where data is lost in transformation
2. Fix property naming consistency (event vs event_name)
3. Verify date range filtering isn't excluding valid events
4. Consider adding logging to dashboard.js transformApiData function

### 🔧 Technical Notes
- Removed 2 API endpoints to stay within Vercel's 12 function limit
- Dashboard expects events with specific structure:
  ```javascript
  {
    event: "form_submit",  // or event_name
    timestamp: "ISO date string",
    session_id: "string",
    visitor_id: "string",
    event_data: { /* form data */ }
  }
  ```
- Cost per lead and ROI currently hardcoded to 0 (need ad spend integration)

### 📊 Verified Data in Supabase
- Total events: 11
- Form submissions: 2
- Page views: 3
- Test events: 5
- All events have proper timestamps and are within last 7 days
